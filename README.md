# Lyrebird Front End Test

An assessment for lyrebird, a small react/redux app that presents an user with a prompt to generate speech from text using his own voice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation instructions 

In the project directory, you can run: 

### `yarn`
or
### `npm install`

Then put your application client id in the .env file in the root of the project. For the redirect url, you should redirect to the app. Use either `localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000`

To use the app, **you should have an account on [Lyrebird](https://www.lyrebird.ai)'s website, and you should have already trained your voice on [Lyrebird](https://www.lyrebird.ai).**

## Run instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
